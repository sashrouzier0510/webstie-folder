<!-- Use eventListeners, functions and conditional statements to create an example that asks for information and then changes 
text and an HTML element based on the information received.

An example idea:

an input field that asks for a username.
a text area to display a welcome message.
a button that toggles a css class and changes a bg color of the body. 
when clicked make the button text read 'change back'
a conditional statement that creates a variable to keep track of the amount of times the button is pressed.  
If that amount is more than 5, display a message that says 'that's enough already' and returns the body to its original bg color. -->
